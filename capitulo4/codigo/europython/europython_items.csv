Carlos Villavicencio,July 2021,"It is well known that Python 3 is an object-oriented language. But if we look back at the roots of the language, functions as first-class objects were part of the initial design.

Augusto Stoffel,July 2021,"In this talk, I will provide a primer on a class of deep learning models known as graph neural networks (GNNs).  These models generalize the well-known convolutional neural networks (CNNs) ubiquitous in computer vision, and the approach of the talk will emphasize that analogy.  Specifically, after a quick general recap on graphs, we will see how to think of an image as a graph where nodes represent pixels and edges represent the relationship of being a neighbor.  After expressing the formulas for a CNN in terms of this graph, it is not hard to imagine ways to pass from the graph of an image to arbitrary graphs.  This way, one naturally arrives at a basic GNN architecture.  Other recent advances, for instance graph attention networks, can also be surveyed, time permitting.","Data Science,Deep Learning,Machine-Learning,Natural Language Processing",Graph neural networks for information extraction with PyTorch

Jose Haro Peralta,July 2021,"This presentation shows how we can use documentation-driven development to minimise the risk of API integration failures. APIs are the gateways that connect our web applications to the world. Microservices rely on them to work together, and frontend applications use them to connect to our backend. Despite their importance, API integration failures are a daily occurrence. There’re many reasons for this, but a common factor is the lack of API documentation, or the use of bad API documentation.,Often, API documentation comes in unstructured formats or in JSON examples, instead of standard formats such as OpenAPI or Schema Definition Language. When we don’t use standards to document our APIs, we give up the whole ecosystem of frameworks and tools built around those standards. Such tools and frameworks are designed to make our lives easier when managing the lifecycle of our APIs.,In documentation-driven development, we write the API specification first, and then we implement the API server and the client against the specification. I’ll show how we can use mock servers to test the client while the backend is being developed, and tools like Dredd and schemathesis to validate the backend implementation. I’ll show how we can use these tools in a CI server to validate our code before it’s released. This approach doesn’t eliminate completely the risk of API integration failures, but it helps to minimise it.","APIs,Deployment/Continuous Integration and Delivery,RESTful,Testing,Web Servers and MicroFWs (Flask/Tornado/Nginx/...)",Documentation-driven development for Python web APIs

These models not only rely on the gradient convergence properties of general backpropagation technique, but also on the final probabilistic states of the Qubits. Essentially there has been quite a development to optimize the gradient convergence of these hybrid models with the help of Fischer approximation and Natural Gradient Descent.The talk would focus on the importance of Quantum Variational Deep Learning Circuits and how they provide an advantage over traditional Autograd based Circuits. The application of Quantum Variational circuits in the field of Reinforcement Learning as well as NLP would be one of the main points of the talk.

Thomas Y. Chen,July 2021,"Machine learning and artificial intelligence have enabled many solutions that tackle real-world problems, from climate change to autonomous vehicle development. However, with any new technology comes novel issues to address, and in the consideration of machine learning, a recurring concern is the interpretability of the models. Particularly, this refers to the ability of humans, and especially end users of the technology, to understand how the model came to its decision. One way of opening up “black box models” (algorithms that are relatively uninterpretable) that are trained on imagery (computer vision models) is to create saliency maps that are qualitative, visual representations of which parts of each image had the most influence in the deep learning model’s prediction for that image. In this talk, we discuss one interesting way of achieving this. After training a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch on an image dataset (which can be anything, such as ImageNet), we explore using the GradCam repository to create gradient-weighted class activation maps, which harness the CNN and uses the gradients of any target concept, flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting important regions in the image for predicting the concept. It is recommended that attendees of this talk are familiar with at least the basics of machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision, but the presentation will not be too technical as to encourage less experienced folks.","Algorithms,Computer Vision,Deep Learning,Machine-Learning",Big Imagery Data Visualization with Gradient-weighted Class Activation Maps
"Marko Ristin,Phillip Schanely,Lauren De bruyn",July 2021,"Good programs are correct programs. Testing is an indispensable tool making sure that the software we produce is correct. The bulk of today’s Python programs are tested using unit tests, on a case-by-case basis. While unit tests are important, thorough tests are tedious to write. A lot of edge cases need to be considered and human errors easily slip in.","Code Analysis,Programming,Software Design,Testing",Automatic Testing of Python Functions Based on Contracts
Ondrej Urban,July 2021,"During my first steps in the field I was promised that machine learning would be automated from the beginning. Unfortunately, once I’ve outsourced looking for the parameters that best matched my data to the machines, I was instead left with having to look for the hyperparameters that define the best model architecture, all by myself. This often ends up being a lengthy manual process. Is there a way to outsource this bit too?","Data Science,Deep Learning,Machine-Learning",Automated Machine Learning With Keras

Rabeea Emad,July 2021,"FastAPI is one of the fastest growing Python web frameworks – in part due to its ease of usage and high performance. In this talk, I will teach you how you can rapidly process European covid vaccine popularity data using Fire, place it into Azure Database for Postgres (for free!) and then leverage FastAPI  to serve them through a back-end. Finally, I will launch the backend online through Azure App Service and use Jupyter to visualize the data from the API to answer interesting questions! Come join me and let the adventure begin!","Public Cloud,Web,python","Analyzing COVID Vaccine Popularity in Europe Using FastAPI, Postgres & Azure"
Markus Holtermann,July 2021,"Every other job opening for an IT position mentions Kubernetes. But unless you’ve worked with Kubernetes or seen it in action, you probably only have a vague idea of what it is, what it does and can do, or how to use it. And that’s understandable. It’s this big, abstract, software, that is supposed to “solve all the problems”. In this talk I’ll go through some of the concepts Kubernetes has. We’ll approach these by deploying a Django application, with the intent, that next time somebody asks you, “Do you know Kubernetes?”, you can confidently answer “Yes!”.","DevOps general,Infrastructure,Operations",An Introduction to Kubernetes ☸️
Christoph Dr. Zimmermann,July 2021,"The presentation introduces RedisGears, a novel approach to Python programming on the server side of an open source real-time NoSQL database. ,Ten years in the making, redis has achieved a significant following among the community concerned with ultra-fast processing of NoSQL-based data. ,With the advent of modules a few years back, redis can be further extended to bridge the gap between the comprehensive set of data structures already offered by the server core and application-specific requirements such as graphs, timeseries data or full-text search capabilities. RedisGears is such a module. At its core, it offers a flexible infrastructure allowing the combination of different modules in addition to scheduling, mapping, filtering and other functionality to process data on the server side. In addition, it allows the execution of Python code on server side, yielding an ultra-performant and flexible approach to the implementation of business logic as part of an application code base.
