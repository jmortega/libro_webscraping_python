After expressing the formulas for a CNN in terms of this graph, it is not hard to imagine ways to pass from the graph of an image to arbitrary graphs.

I’ll show how we can use these tools in a CI server to validate our code before it’s released.

Examples of cyber-attacks include phishing, ransomware, fake news, fake medicine, extortion, and insider frauds. Cyber forensics is a field that deals with the investigation of digital crimes by analyzing, examining, identifying, and recovering digital evidence from electronic devices and producing them in the court of law. Python has a great collection of built-in modules for digital forensics tasks. The talk begins with an introduction to digital crimes, digital forensics, the process of investigation, and the collection of evidence. Next, I will cover the various python modules and built-in functions required to build your first cyber forensic application.

{"title": ["Big Imagery Data Visualization with Gradient-weighted Class Activation Maps"], "author": ["Thomas Y. Chen"], "description": ["Machine learning and artificial intelligence have enabled many solutions that tackle real-world problems, from climate change to autonomous vehicle development. However, with any new technology comes novel issues to address, and in the consideration of machine learning, a recurring concern is the interpretability of the models. Particularly, this refers to the ability of humans, and especially end users of the technology, to understand how the model came to its decision. One way of opening up “black box models” (algorithms that are relatively uninterpretable) that are trained on imagery (computer vision models) is to create saliency maps that are qualitative, visual representations of which parts of each image had the most influence in the deep learning model’s prediction for that image. In this talk, we discuss one interesting way of achieving this. After training a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch on an image dataset (which can be anything, such as ImageNet), we explore using the GradCam repository to create gradient-weighted class activation maps, which harness the CNN and uses the gradients of any target concept, flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting important regions in the image for predicting the concept. It is recommended that attendees of this talk are familiar with at least the basics of machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision, but the presentation will not be too technical as to encourage less experienced folks."], "date": "July 2021", "tags": ["Algorithms", "Computer Vision", "Deep Learning", "Machine-Learning"]}
